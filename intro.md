# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING: INTRODUCTION

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the creation of custom class for special objects. An object is an instance of a class, which is a blueprint that described the properties and methods of said object. 

Here's how to make a class:

```python
# Example of Class

class HUman:
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name

    def __str(self):
        return ('Person Object Called: {self.name}')

```

## Some Key Terms so Far:
- Class
- Def
- Init
- Self
- Str

Wrap up.
